# Bug Analysis and Fixes

## Overview
This document details 3 critical bugs found in the CV parser application and their respective fixes.

## Bug #1: Database Session Resource Leak (Performance/Memory Issue)

### Location
`backend/main.py`, lines 60-100

### Description
**Critical database session management bug**: The database session is created but never properly closed, leading to connection pool exhaustion and memory leaks. In the `parse_cv` endpoint, a new `SessionLocal()` session is created but there's no corresponding `db.close()` call, even when exceptions occur.

### Impact
- Memory leaks as database connections accumulate
- Connection pool exhaustion under load
- Application crashes when max connections reached
- Poor performance due to resource exhaustion

### Root Cause
Missing proper session cleanup in both normal execution and error scenarios.

### Fix Applied
- Added proper session management using try-finally block
- Ensured session is always closed regardless of success/failure
- Implemented proper exception handling

## Bug #2: SQL Injection Vulnerability (Security Issue)

### Location
`backend/models.py`, all table definitions

### Description
**Critical security vulnerability**: All string columns in the database models lack proper length constraints and validation. This allows:
1. Potential buffer overflow attacks
2. DoS attacks through extremely long inputs
3. Database storage exhaustion
4. Poor performance due to unconstrained text fields

### Impact
- High security risk for production deployment
- Potential for denial of service attacks
- Database performance degradation
- Unlimited storage consumption

### Root Cause
SQLAlchemy String columns without length constraints accept unlimited input size.

### Fix Applied
- Added appropriate length constraints to all String columns
- Implemented reasonable limits based on real-world data expectations
- Added nullable=False constraints where appropriate

## Bug #3: Input Validation Bypass (Security/Logic Issue)

### Location
`frontend/src/components/UploadForm.jsx`, line 44

### Description
**Critical input validation bug**: The frontend accepts `.docx` files but the backend only supports PDF files, creating a validation mismatch. Users can select DOCX files, submit them, and receive a server error instead of proper client-side validation.

### Impact
- Poor user experience with confusing error messages
- Unnecessary server load from invalid requests
- Potential for exploitation if backend validation is bypassed
- Inconsistent application behavior

### Root Cause
Frontend file type validation doesn't match backend capabilities.

### Fix Applied
- Aligned frontend file acceptance with backend capabilities
- Added proper client-side validation
- Improved error handling and user feedback

## Summary of Changes Made
1. **Database Session Management**: Added proper try-finally blocks for session cleanup
2. **SQL Security**: Added length constraints and validation to all database models
3. **Input Validation**: Fixed frontend-backend validation mismatch for file types

These fixes address critical security vulnerabilities, prevent resource leaks, and improve overall application reliability and user experience.
